# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Introduction: #
We wanted to create a space for people to create memes in real time with other enjoyers of memes. While there are sites that allow users to create a meme and share it elsewhere (eg. https://makeameme.org/), there are not many that allow users to create a meme while others watch and judge. 
      
Memeify allows users to upload a picture, and memeify it by creating a caption (comment). Users can add their own comment to the image, creating a meme (image + comment). Users may like/dislike the comments to determine which meme is best.  

# Technologies Used: React, Express, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, mongoose, MongoDB Atlas, Multer, axios, downloadjs, HTML, CSS, validator, passport

# Getting Started:#
https://memeify-app.herokuapp.com/
https://trello.com/b/tsL1x0vv/unit-3-project

# Unsolved Problems: #
User experience improvements: Login button persists after login/register; deployed development and not production; 

# Future Enhancements: #
Terms of Service on Registration; self-moderation credentials to allow users to remove harmful or unwanted comments from their own postings; quality of life improvements (fonts, profile page with list of own posts and comments, like functionality (likes/dislikes are in the code, but are only displayed on posts, not on comments); most liked/disliked memes/comments; warnings/guidelines for files that are too large/wrong format.
